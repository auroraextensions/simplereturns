## Description

Simple Returns provides enhanced RMA functionality primarily intended for Magento Open Source,
but can also be used with Magento Commerce, if desired. It extends the default RMA capabilities
built into Magento Open Source<sup>1</sup>, and offers a range of additional features to improve
the RMA experience for both customers and administrators alike.

## Features

Simple Returns is packed with features that can substantially improve an RMA pipeline.
The default RMA functionality provided by Magento Open Source is very limited, as it
does not allow customers to initiate the RMA process via web UI, nor does it provide
customers the capability to generate and print shipping labels via web UI. Merchants
lacking critical self-service RMA features, such as those provided by Simple Returns,
make the RMA process more difficult and cumbersome for customers, which can lead to
symptoms like fewer repeat customers and increased negative reviews.

### Customer

+ Create, edit, delete RMA file attachments

### Administrator

### Developer

+ Plugin-friendly classes and methods
+ Events dispatched for most major actions
+ Actively developed and maintained by Aurora Extensions, an [ExtDN member](https://extdn.org) and [Magento partner](https://partners.magento.com/portal/details/partner/id/2163/)

### Other

+ Free<sup>2</sup>, forever and always!

## Notes

1. Not to be confused with `Magento_Rma`, which is a premium module available with Magento Commerce.
2. Simple Returns is free to everyone, but comes at a cost to us. To help us continue our efforts,
   please consider purchasing [Simple Returns Pro](https://auroraextensions.com/products/simple-returns-pro),
   our premium RMA extension that builds on top of Simple Returns to provide more advanced features
   that can further optimize your RMA pipeline and improve customer experience.
